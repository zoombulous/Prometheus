    Prometheus: Reinforcement Learning Agent with Actor-Critic
    
    Purpose:
    Prometheus is a reinforcement learning agent that implements the Actor-Critic algorithm 
    to learn optimal policies in various environments. It provides a flexible and efficient 
    framework for training and evaluating reinforcement learning agents.
    
    Required Input:
    - Environment: A Gym environment compatible with reinforcement learning tasks.
    - Number of Episodes: An integer specifying the number of episodes for training.
    
    Expected Output:
    - Training Scores: A plot displaying the training scores over episodes.
    - Comparison with Past Results: If past scores are provided, Prometheus will plot a comparison 
      between current and past training results.
    - Improvement Percentage: Percentage improvement in scores compared to past results, if past 
      scores are provided.
