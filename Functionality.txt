### Functionality:

1. **Prometheus Class**: 
   - Implements a reinforcement learning agent with the Actor-Critic algorithm.
   - Performs training using the A2C algorithm.
   - Runs the training loop for a specified number of episodes.
   - Provides options for verbose output during training.
   - Supports comparison with past training results and calculates improvement percentage if past scores are provided.
   - Includes methods for testing various functionalities of the agent.

2. **Run Training Method**:
   - Main method for running the training loop.
   - Accepts parameters such as environment name, number of episodes, verbosity, and past scores.
   - Trains the agent and plots training scores.
   - Calculates and displays improvement percentage if past scores are provided.

3. **Test Methods**:
   - `test_training_process()`: Tests if the agent interacts with the environment and learns over episodes.
   - `test_plotting()`: Tests the plotting functionality by checking if training scores are plotted correctly.
   - `test_improvement_percentage()`: Tests the calculation of improvement percentage.
   - `test_error_handling()`: Tests the error handling mechanism.
   - `test_automatic_rerun()`: Tests the automatic rerun functionality.
   - `test_input_parameters()`: Tests the input parameters by changing them and checking if the changes take effect without errors.

4. **Main Script**:
   - Runs tests using pytest when executed directly.
   - Initializes an instance of the Prometheus class and runs the tests.
